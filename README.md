Developmental course of anxiety and emotional dysregulation during childhood and adolescence: a transdiagnostic approach - Identification of risk factors for significant transitions

# Description 
Problems with anxiety and worrying are among the most prevalent concerns in childhood and adolescence (Copeland et al., 2014; Essau et al., 2018). Bathelt et al. (2018) recently showed that that these problems can occur in isolation but also in combination with other behavioural problems such as inattention and hyperactivity. There is also an increasing literature on the effect of anxiety on learning, academic attainment, and cognitive development (Robinson et al., 2013; Maloney et al., 2014).
However, current approaches to characterising psychopathology and mental health in children and adolescents are mostly static and do not necessarily incorporate information on the developmental context in which children experience these problems. This approach decreases the chance to offer relevant treatments or interventions before the symptoms escalates, often during the critical period of adolescence. 
This project will focus on emotional dysregulation with a particular emphasis on anxiety. We will study how these problems relate to other behavioural at different points in development from 5 to 17 years-old and detect children who display atypical transitions from normal to maladaptive behaviour or vice-versa. We will subsample a population-representative national birth cohort and look at the data for children and adolescents presenting with emotional dysregulation and/or anxiety. We will apply data-driven machine learning techniques to identify subgroups of behavioural profiles in this subsample. We will then describe differences between these subgroups using a range of demographic and cognitive variables. Finally, we plan to characterise transitions from one subgroup to another between age groups by identifying risk factors that predict atypical transitions. 

# Analysis 
The Python and R code in this repository was used to clean, preprocess, cluster and model data from the Millenium Cohort Study. The data are not included in the repository. 

The analysis code is presented for example purposes only and is not reproducable as is.
