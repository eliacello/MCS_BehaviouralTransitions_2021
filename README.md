# MCS_BehaviouralTransitions_2021
Population-Level Transitions in Observed Difficulties Through Childhood and Adolescence

# Description 
The purpose of the current study was to follow the behavioural profiles of children longitudinally from age 5 to 17. Our aim was to chart not only changes in the overall range and complexity of difficulties, but to map longitudinal transitions in profile. We used the Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative UK birth cohort of approximately 19,000 individuals, and focussed on three pivotal developmental points: early childhood (age 5), late childhood (age 11) and adolescence (age 17). Behavioural difficulties likely change in nature between these ages, with known pronounced changes in physical features (e.g. puberty), brain structure and function (e.g. maturation of frontal lobe with grey matter volumes peaking at 11 years old followed by synaptic pruning and myelination), cognitive abilities (e.g. language development, problem-solving, attention span, risk-taking), social context (e.g. group identity, peer pressure) and environmental context (e.g. parenting, family responsibility, school setting). 

We focused our analysis on the validated derived subscales of the parent-reported Strength and Difficulties (SDQ) questionnaire, i.e. conduct, hyperactivity, peer, emotional and antisocial problems. After reducing the dimensional space using a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), we used k-means clustering to then identify subgroups of children and adolescents with different behavioural profiles within this reduced space. We then characterised the most common cluster transitions from early to late childhood and from late childhood to adolescence. Finally, using a regularised form of gradient boosting algorithm for classification (XGBoost), we subsequently identified longitudinal and cross-sectional risk factors of these transitions using the preceding datasets from when the children were 9 months old, 3, 5, 7 and 11 years old.


# Analysis 
The Python and R code in this repository was used to clean, preprocess, cluster and model data from the Millenium Cohort Study. The data are not included in the repository. 

The analysis code is presented for example purposes only and is not reproducable as is.
